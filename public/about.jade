                    p Tease got its' wings in a small shop on 15th NW in Ballard.

                        p Hello! I'm a stylist and co-owner of Tease. I have been in the industry for 10 years, specializing in balayage and custom hair cutting. I began my career in Eastern Washington at an upscale men's barber shop, learning the techniques to properly tailor men's hair.
                        p After 2 years of growing a loyal client-base, I moved on to work independently at Studio One Salon in Kennewick. Here is where I really honed my craft and my love for hair flourished. After 4 amazing years there, I relocated to Seattle to be with my husband.
                        p For the past 4 years of living in Seattle, I've extended my skill set into makeup artistry and specialized eyebrow waxing while working for Anastasia Beverly Hills. I'm very passionate about staying up-to-date on current trends and techniques as continued education is very important to me.
                        p Painting is one of my favorite things when I'm working with hair. I love to create depth and dimension in every color I do. Cutting hair was my first love and I take great pride in customizing every head of hair I get my hands on.
                        p Thank you for your interest and I look forward to making your hair-goals a reality!
